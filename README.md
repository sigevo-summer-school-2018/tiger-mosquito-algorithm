# The tiger mosquito algorithm

One of the teams in the [SIGEvo summer school 2018](https://sigevo-summer-school-2018.github.io).

## Description of the algorithm

A new evolutionary algorithm inspired from the tiger mosquito plague fighting techniques.

An algorithm that removes mosquitoes that carry dengue virus, zykova virus, yellow fever virus. You will choose a pheromone to eliminate mosquitoes, a good pheromone and a bad pheromone to make a pheromone that attracts tiger mosquitoes.
1. Initialize the pheromone.
2. Measure the fitness of pheromones.
3. Use the tormant selection to get the results.
4. Cross over each result to get a new generation.
5. repeat

A more extended description will be shown in [this page](algorithm.md)

## The team

[5 students from all over the world, and a tutor](team.md).
