# tiger-mosquito-algorithm
A new evolutionary algorithm inspired from the tiger mosquito plague fighting techniques.

An algorithm that removes mosquitoes that carry dengue virus, zykova virus, yellow fever virus. You will choose a pheromone to eliminate mosquitoes, a good pheromone and a bad pheromone to make a pheromone that attracts tiger mosquitoes.
