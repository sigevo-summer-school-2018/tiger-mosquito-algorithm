def fitness(chromosome,n,k,epistasis):
    """
	Implements the problem NK-landscape where N is the number of bits
	of the bit string or number of decision variables (binary), and K 
	determines the epistasis or the effect of each variable on others.
    
    The calculation is done in a nextdoor fashion, taking groups of 2^k,
    and considering the list as cyclical.
    
    Required
    :param chromosome: A list of int composed by 0s or 1s.
    :param n: The number of decision variables.
    :param k: The epistasis bit.
    :param epistasis: a matrix that defines the effect of each variable
    to others.
    
    :returns: A single float that represents the fitness of the individual.
