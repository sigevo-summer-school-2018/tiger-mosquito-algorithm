According to this concept, all individuals belonging to the population are subject to pheromone update. In contrast, there is also the opinion that the pheromone of individual change is limited to the child generation. We propose update formula corresponding to the ideas, respectively. \n",

Additionary, the pheromone of parents $\\mathrm{Parents}(x_i)$ is also updated by $$ \\begin{equation*} p(\\mathrm{Parents}(x_i)) = p(\\mathrm{Parents}(x_i)) + Q^{h} p(x_i)\\end{equation*}, $$ where $Q \\enspace (0 \\leq Q \\leq 1)$  is coffactor and $h$ is an integer value indicating how many generations are away from the child individual $x_i$. \n",
